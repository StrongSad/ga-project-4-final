User Stories:

  The use for this application is very simple.  Someone wants to go somewhere but may or may not be able to afford the trip. 
  they post to this website looking for someone who is also going to that location or going through where they would like to go. Then they can do basic communication on the website but ultimatley this is just means to find potential people to car pool with over long or short distances.

  not really a user story but an explantion of use.


Still working on:

  Somethings I wasn't able to finish were first off the styeling, user identification between trips, full crud on trips and messages.
