  <h2>About Road Trip Buddies</h2>
  <br>
  <div>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>Road trip buddies was made as a project while attending the web development boot camp at General Assembly. The Idea behind this application is to help make going on road trips a little easier by finding others who need to go to the same location but may either not have the means to get there or just want to save a little cash by finding someone to travel with. </p>

    <h3>The Tech</h3>
    <p>I used the mean stack to develop this project as well as JWT auth. Nothing else to really say about this. </p>
